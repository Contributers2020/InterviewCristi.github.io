			<li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:51</p> <p class="message">Thank you for interviewing me. Nice to meet you. Cheers!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:51</p> <p class="message">Great YouTubers. So with that answer I have no questions remaining, and I must say, the answers were amazing and very interesting. Thank you a lot for giving your valuable time to me and to the interview. See ya!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:49</p> <p class="message">I would definitely love a collaboration with giants such as MrBeast (Gaming), maybe MARCUSK (a friend of mine that is doing so good right now) and maybe Beluga, even though I don&#x27;t see a way of us collabing.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:46</p> <p class="message">Actually I have another questiton in mind! Which YouTube Creators would you want to collaborate in future?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:46</p> <p class="message">Oh, that will be a great addition to YouTube and a big benefit for the small creators as well.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:45</p> <p class="message">Its features. I&#x27;d love a new feature where if you go to a specific page it lets you view &quot;Content you might like from small youtubers&quot;. This feature would help growing a lot, not like it is right now.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:43</p> <p class="message">Great! My 13th and the last question is that if you had the power to change something about YouTube, what would it be?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:42</p> <p class="message">My advice would be that, they should focus on the quality of the video. Have a strong title, a description with a bunch of keywords on the topic you&#x27;re looking to show people.
 Don&#x27;t look at graphs, but look at quality -&gt; as Elon Musk said a while ago.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:40</p> <p class="message">Oh, really Among Us is sorta dead now. My 12th question is what advice would you want to give to those who are trying to become a YouTuber?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:37</p> <p class="message">It was obviously Among Us when I had a huge community on the game. Really depends on the period, but right now I don&#x27;t really have any favorite game, as I don&#x27;t really enjoy Among Us anymore. Braains.io still has a point today, where I still play it regularly, while Among Us which I didn&#x27;t even touch for 3 weeks.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:35</p> <p class="message">Oh. My eleventh question is that what is your favourite game? Is it braains.io which marked the start of the career, or Among us, which gave you a big boost in subscribers and views, or any other game?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:32</p> <p class="message">My original goal was 10,000 subscribers. I never thought, in less than a month of hitting 10K subs I would be at 150,000. Sooner or later I got to 200K. I never thought I would be where I am right now, truly a dream...</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:31</p> <p class="message">Yeah. My tenth question is that you have over 200k subscribers. Did you ever think you‚Äôd reach as many like it?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:29</p> <p class="message">Outside YouTube I like hanging out with friends outside, and going for a fresh walk. Also recently I started going to gym, as I gotta stay strong outside of social media üí™</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:27</p> <p class="message">Wow, that was an interesting story! My ninth question is when you‚Äôre not working on a YouTube video, what do you love to do the most?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:26</p> <p class="message">&quot;Cristi&quot; is a short-name of my real name. So yeah that sums it up. But Cristi123 is another story. So I had my original name &quot;Cristi43&quot;, before changing it to Cristi123 as it was taken in that &quot;braains.io&quot; game. Since Cristi43 was taken by someone else, I went with Cristi123 and changed my name on all social medias to this name. I don&#x27;t regret it :)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:23</p> <p class="message">Okay. I am sure this will happen one day. My eight question is where did you get the name ‚ÄúCristi‚Äù from? Can you please explain the story behind it.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:22</p> <p class="message">Firstly I would be shocked, knowing someone knows something about me. I would say hello, have a talk with them and take some photos if they want to. Imagine that happening though..</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:21</p> <p class="message">Great. My seventh question is how do you feel when one of your fans spots you irl and shouts out your name?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:20</p> <p class="message">Yes they do! At start they didn&#x27;t like the content and said &quot;why are you wasting time on this&quot;, but now it&#x27;s another story. They watch (almost) all of my videos and they seem to enjoy it now.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:19</p> <p class="message">Ohh. (I bet you didn&#x27;t deserved the massive downfall) My sixth question is do your family-members watch your videos or know about this channel? If yes, what is their reaction when they see one of your videos some time?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:17</p> <p class="message">I considered YouTube as a full time job, until my downfall. I would love to do YouTube as a full time job, but if that won&#x27;t be the case in the future, I might just become a programmer. There&#x27;s still time to decide as i&#x27;m still in education.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:16</p> <p class="message">Ohh, that is cool. My fifth question is do you do YouTube full time. If yes, what would you do if YouTube wouldn‚Äôt have existed?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:14</p> <p class="message">I got very recognized in a browser game called &quot;braains.io&quot;. Every time I join a game or play I get recognized by at least 5 people per lobby. Even though it&#x27;s not the reason I am here today, braains.io had a big impact on my career, where I got my first 10K subs!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:12</p> <p class="message">Wow. My fourth question is do you have a favourite video you created like personally? If yes, which one?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:10</p> <p class="message">Yeah, I mostly got influenced by a YouTuber called &quot;TrueBizcuit&quot; back in 2017th period. Sadly I didn&#x27;t have the gear to start recording the game, but back in 2019, after I finally got the gear I started my journey on YouTube. He was a big influence for me :)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:08</p> <p class="message">Okay. So my third question is that was there any YouTuber who influenced you to make videos or some day you got the thought that &quot;lets make videos on YouTube!&quot;?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:07</p> <p class="message">Unfortunately no, but since I&#x27;m Romanian, I could bet it was a Romanian youtuber.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:06</p> <p class="message">Oh, amazing. Can you remember who was the first creator whose video you watched on YouTube?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:06</p> <p class="message">I discovered YouTube 6 years ago, when I just got access to social medias. It was when I got my first phone.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:05</p> <p class="message">Okay. So my first question is how and when did you discover YouTube?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:04</p> <p class="message">sure :)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:04</p> <p class="message">So let us start with the questions?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:04</p> <p class="message">Okay thanks for coming</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#e74c3c">cristi123#0123</p><p class="time">Today at 15:04</p> <p class="message">yea</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Contributers2020#8168</p><p class="time">Today at 15:01</p> <p class="message">&lt;@!282766323417743360&gt; you there?</p></li>
